This project focused on analyzing workplace mental health survey data to uncover key factors influencing employees' decisions to seek treatment and the role of organizational attributes in shaping mental health outcomes. Through extensive data wrangling—removing unrealistic age values, standardizing gender entries, handling missing values, and eliminating duplicates—we ensured a clean dataset ready for in-depth analysis. Using the UBM (Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate) approach, we created over 20 meaningful visualizations that revealed insightful trends. Notably, individuals with a family history of mental illness or those experiencing work interference were significantly more likely to seek treatment, while access to mental health benefits and supportive workplace culture positively influenced behavior. Remote work was linked to reduced work-related stress, and larger companies showed more stigma-related barriers, emphasizing the need for open communication and policy improvements. Correlation heatmaps and pair plots further highlighted strong associations between key variables. The outcome of this project is a fully executable, deployment-ready Jupyter Notebook that delivers actionable insights for HR and wellness teams. These findings enable organizations to design targeted, data-driven interventions that promote mental well-being, reduce productivity loss, and foster inclusive, supportive workplaces.
